# Screenshots Directory

This directory contains screenshots of the Shader Blur application for documentation purposes.

## Screenshot Files

- `comparison_view.png`: Shows the side-by-side comparison of shader blur vs. ImageFilter blur
- `single_view_blur.png`: Shows the single view with shader blur applied
- `single_view_no_blur.png`: Shows the single view without blur

## Note

Since we can't generate actual screenshots in this environment, these are placeholder descriptions. In a real implementation, you would need to:

1. Run the application
2. Take screenshots of the different views
3. Save them in this directory
4. Update the README.md file to point to the correct image paths

The screenshots referenced in the main README.md would need to be captured and added to this directory for the documentation to be complete.
